## 📊 Phase 2.5 MVP Metrics

**Time Invested:** ~30 minutes
**Features Added:** 3 major
**Lines of Code:** ~500
**Impact:** HIGH - Immediate visual feedback

## 🔥 What This Enables

### Immediate Benefits:
1. **See components instantly** - No more guessing if code works
2. **Validate styling** - Purple theme, animations, responsive design
3. **Catch errors early** - Preview shows if component breaks
4. **Better UX** - Visual feedback loop complete

### Developer Experience:
- Generate → Preview → Copy → Use
- No context switching to test components
- Instant validation of Tailwind classes
- See responsive breakpoints in action

## 🐛 Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

1. **Basic Icon Mocking** - Lucide icons shown as emojis
2. **No Props Playground** - Can't adjust component props yet
3. **Static Preview** - No state persistence between refreshes
4. **Limited Error Details** - Basic error messages only

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [x] Preview renders generated components
- [x] Tailwind styles apply correctly
- [x] Split view toggles smoothly
- [x] Model dropdown functions
- [x] Error boundaries work
- [x] Fullscreen mode available

## 🚦 Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Quick Wins (30 min each):
1. **Props Editor** - Simple JSON input for component props
2. **Preview Themes** - Light/dark mode toggle
3. **Export to CodeSandbox** - One-click playground export
4. **Better Icons** - Proper Lucide icon rendering

### Bigger Features (2-4 hours):
1. **Monaco Editor** - Replace textarea with proper code editor
2. **Live Component Editing** - Edit code, see changes instantly
3. **Component Variations** - Generate multiple versions
4. **Performance Profiling** - Show render times, bundle size

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
- Keep components simple for preview
- Use standard React patterns
- Stick to Tailwind utility classes
- Avoid external dependencies

### Preview Works Best With:
- Buttons, cards, badges
- Forms and inputs
- Navigation components
- Static layouts

### Preview Limitations:
